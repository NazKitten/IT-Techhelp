# IT-Techhelp
This is more of crticles that I was able to grab that might help those who want to become Helpdesk or work on computers but need help with locating and using tools offered either by microsoft, Mac os or linux. WIP - Please keep this in mind and is personal hobby then professional or constant work. 

There will be more 'Articles' or in this case, commits to this project to help guide people. The goal of this project is to be used to inspire others to get into IT. New or old, Smart or not, everyone should have the ability to either work on their own device or work on others (under the correct assumption that damage wont be dealt to the machine or is a last case senario, please keep in mind this is more to help freelance IT then professional IT but can help in the professional space).
